Chat Application Using Socket Programming with GUI on Tkinter

Introducing a secure chat application built with Python’s socket programming, designed to provide robust user authentication and safeguard the confidentiality and integrity of all communications. This system allows users to register with unique credentials, securely log in, and engage in private conversations with other authenticated users.

The platform uses a client-to-client communication model, where connections are established by specifying the recipient’s username, ensuring enhanced privacy and control over interactions. Seamless socket communication ensures efficient messaging, while integrated blocking mechanisms protect against unauthorized access, allowing users to initiate, manage, and terminate chats securely and intuitively.

Running the application is simple. Just install Tkinter, and use the following commands:
python server.py
python client.py
Make sure to run both files simultaneously in separate terminals to establish a connection between the server and client.
